abstract = {In a time of rapid climate change, understanding what may encourage sustainable consumer behaviour is a vital but difficult challenge. Using an attitude network approach, we investigated which associations people have towards conventional and bio-based plastic in order to develop an empirically-based approach to initiate attitude- and behaviour change. With a qualitative study (NÂ =Â 97), we distilled 25 evaluative reactions (i.e. beliefs, emotions, and behaviours) that encompass people's attitudes towards using (bio-based) plastic. These reactions were used to create a new scale, which was subsequently tested among 508 online participants. The resulting data was then used to build a network displaying relationships between participants' evaluative reactions regarding plastic use. Analyses of this network indicated that guilt was most strongly connected to people's willingness to pay more for bio-based plastic products. Based on this, we conducted another study (NÂ =Â 285) in which we experimentally manipulated guilt (general guilt, personal guilt, and control condition) to determine its effects on people's willingness to pay for a sustainable cause. Results indicate that manipulating guilt can lead participants to donate more to a sustainable cause. This effect was fully mediated by self-reported guilt. Determining which factors influence consumers to change their buying behaviour towards sustainability is the first step in creating a demand for more sustainable products amongst the public and investors.}

abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

abstract = {Abstract Objectives To evaluate the replicability of oral health literacy (OHL) network models across the general community and a sample of older adults from Brazil. Methods Data were obtained from two oral health surveys conducted with a total of 1138 participants. OHL was measured using the short form Health Literacy in Dentistry scale (HeLD-14). A regularized partial correlation network was estimated for each sample. Dimensionality and structural stability were examined via exploratory graph analysis. Network properties compared included global strength, edge weights, and centrality estimates. Model replicability was examined fitting the general community model to the older participants' data. Results Six dimensions with the exact same item composition were detected in both network models. Only the Receptivity domain in the older adults sample yielded low structural stability. Strong correlations were observed between edge weights (Ï„: 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.62â€“0.74) and between node strength estimates (Ï„: 0.63; 95\% CI: 0.36â€“0.89). No statistically significant differences were found for global strength. The fit of the older adults sample to the HeLD-14 network structure of the general community sample was satisfactory. Conclusion Network models OHL replicated across the general community and a sample of older adults. The psychometric network approach is a useful tool to evaluate the measurement equivalence of OHL instruments across populations.},

    abstract = { Network psychometrics is a new direction in psychological research that conceptualizes psychological constructs as systems of interacting variables. In network analysis, variables are represented as nodes, and their interactions yield (partial) associations. Current estimation methods mostly use a frequentist approach, which does not allow for proper uncertainty quantification of the model and its parameters. Here, we outline a Bayesian approach to network analysis that offers three main benefits. In particular, applied researchers can use Bayesian methods to (1) determine structure uncertainty, (2) obtain evidence for edge inclusion and exclusion (i.e., distinguish conditional dependence or independence between variables), and (3) quantify parameter precision. In this article, we provide a conceptual introduction to Bayesian inference, describe how researchers can facilitate the three benefits for networks, and review the available R packages. In addition, we present two user-friendly software solutions: a new R package, easybgm, for fitting, extracting, and visualizing the Bayesian analysis of networks and a graphical user interface implementation in JASP. The methodology is illustrated with a worked-out example of a network of personality traits and mental health. }

 abstract={Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce the R package BDgraph which performs Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models (decomposable and non-decomposable) with continuous, discrete, and mixed variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the Bayesian literature, including that of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Dobra and Mohammadi (2018). To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R, and the package has parallel computing capabilities. In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate datasets taken from the literature and used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main part of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the packageâ€™s functionality in both real and artificial examples.},

The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) is a nationally representative study of 9,412 people aged 50 years or older, residing in 70 municipalities across the 5 Brazilian regions. ELSI-Brazil allows investigations of the aging process, its health, psychosocial and economic determinants, and societal consequences. The baseline examination (2015?2016) included detailed household and individual interviews and physical measurements (blood pressure, anthropometry, grip strength, and timed walk and balance tests). Blood tests and sample storage were performed in a subsample of study participants. Subsequent waves are planned for every 3 years. The study adopts a conceptual framework common to other large-scale longitudinal studies of aging in the world, such as the Health and Retirement Study, allowing cross-national comparisons. The goal of ELSI-Brazil is not only to build an understanding of aging in a large, Western, middle-income country in a rapid demographic transition but also to provide scientific data to support and study policy changes that may affect older adults. We describe the methodology of the study and some descriptive results of the baseline survey.}",

In addition, we allow to relax the stationarity assumption of both models by introducing time-varying versions of MGMs and mVAR models based on a kernel weighting approach. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving systems and allow to identify external influences on the model structure such as the impact of interventions.

For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results. In this article, we introduce qgraph by applying the package functions to data from the NEO-PI-R, a widely used personality questionnaire.},
